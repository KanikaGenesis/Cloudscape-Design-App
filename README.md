# Cloudscape Design System Workshop

This project is the result of completing the [Cloudscape Design System Workshop](https://catalog.us-east-1.prod.workshops.aws/workshops/5b7fe737-7ea2-4c4d-b572-76df6adabd47/en-US). The workshop guides you through building a responsive and accessible web application for cloud management using the open-source Cloudscape Design System.

## Overview

Cloudscape is an open-source design system developed by Amazon Web Services (AWS) for creating intuitive, engaging, and inclusive user experiences at scale. It provides a comprehensive set of guidelines, design resources, and front-end components to streamline web application development. :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}

## Workshop Steps

The workshop is structured into three main steps:

### Step 1: Create the Basic Layout

In this step, we set up the foundational layout of the application, establishing the primary structure and navigation elements.

Here, we incorporated a table view to display data in a structured tabular format, utilizing Cloudscape's table components for enhanced functionality and accessibility.
